# Getting-cleaning-data-coursera
Assignment for the Coursera course on Getting and Cleaning Data (week 4). The purpose of the project is to reorganize data
collected from the accelerometer in Samsung Galaxy. Read the codebook.md to get more information about the dataset.

# Guidance
Read through the CodeBook and the run_analysis.R script to get a general understanding of this project, the steps taken in the analysis, and the output file. The script downloads the UCI HAR Dataset (after checking it hasn't been downloaded before).

# Contents
* CodeBook.md - Describes the experiment data and the steps taken to summarize the data.
* run_analysis.R - R script to merge, organize and summarize the experiment data.

# Required R packages
The R packages data.table, dplyr, tidyr and plyr are required to run this script. 
# Output
The tidy data set is saved in a text file, "tidydata.txt", in the working directory.
